# LowOrderFIRs
This document provides guidance for coding low order FIR filters to run on AI Engines in Xilinx Versal ACAP devices.

The focus is on kernel code development in C using the low-level intrinsic API.

Example code is developed throughout the document, with detailed explanations of intrinsic
concepts and parameterization including the permute squares.

A basic understanding of FIR filters, C language, and the Xilinx Vitis tools is presumed.
